## A example of use SDL_gpu with ImGui

This is a demo of using ImGui with https://github.com/grimfang4/sdl-gpu in your SDL2 game.

### Build

You need to build and install SDL_gpu first.
The cmake macro `FindSDL_gpu` only works in unix-like systems, so you can build this demo in Linux/macOS only at the moment.

### Tested environment

1. Ubuntu 18.04
2. macOS 10.14
